<h2>About Ignite</h2>
<p><strong>Five minutes, 20 slides. What would you say?</strong> At every Ignite, 16 artists, technologists, thinkers, and personalities will take the stage to answer this challenge.</p>
<p>Ignite was started in Seattle in 2006 by Brady Forrest and Bre Pettis. Since then 100s of 5 minute talks have been given across the world. There are thriving Ignite communities in Seattle, Portland, Paris, and now, <strong>right here in Baltimore!</strong></p>
